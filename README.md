# Personalized_emotion_recognition

Through the development of smartphones and wearable devices, research on human emotion recognition based on mobile sensing is becoming active. While previous studies showed good performance in emotion recognition, emotional signals collected from sensor data are highly heterogeneous depending on the user. In this work, we revisit the limitations of existing learning methods using small dataset, and contribute to creating personalization models using the concept of meta-learning, which can quickly adapt to new tasks for small samples. In this work, we compare random task sampling, cluster-based random sampling, and individual task sampling methods for meta-learning. results show that cluster-based random sampling has the best performance of 69% accuracy and 71% f1 score, and present a unique method for regularization methods to prevent overfitting during task sampling.
